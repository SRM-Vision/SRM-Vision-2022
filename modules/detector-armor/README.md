# Armor detector

This version of armor detector is using TensorRT to accelerate a modefied version of yolov5-face recognization.

The model output structure are as "data-structure/bbox_t.h"

```c++
struct alignas(4) bbox_t {
  cv::Point2f points[4];
  float confidence;
  int color;
  int id;
}
```

## Note:

**color:  0: blue 1: red 2:grey 3: purple**

**id:     0: sentry 1-5: car nums 6: base**

## Warnning! ***fountpost id is unkown***

This version of tensorrt is using fp16 for inference. Model are stored as onnx files,
after the first loading, cache files will be generated for less loading time in future runs.
